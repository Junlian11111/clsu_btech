                <h2>Development of new technological systems</h2>
                <p>Bananas and cacao are important crops for food security and economic development in developing countries, but they are subject to intractable diseases for which control methods have not been established. In order to rein in these diseases, we propose to introduce disease outbreak prediction apps, and apply both disinfection and proactive countermeasures such as disinfections, fertilizer management, and cultivation management. In addition, we intend to collect various fungi, including pathogens, from banana and cacao fields, establish a microbe library and make effective use of microbial resources.</p>

                <h2>Contribute to sustainable banana and cacao production</h2>
                <p>The Philippines is a major producer of bananas for export, and is also focusing on cacao production. By preventing these diseases, which have constrained important crops throughout the world, and by achieving sustainable production, we aim to prevent the problems stemming from decreased crop yields. In addition, we plan to help reduce environmental pollution and damage to the health of local populations resulting from improper application of agricultural chemicals.</p>
